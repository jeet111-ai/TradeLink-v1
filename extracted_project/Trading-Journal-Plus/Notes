Changes to be made - 
In Trade Quality (R Multiple) the dates in X- axis are incorrect so make it to real current dates.
my user wants - for ex-> if he bought Ril shares (longterm or Intraday or Futures) of 1000 qty @ ₹3000 and sell in multiple orders like 100qty then 500 qty, so right now in master ledger each new entry is made, in active journal also every sell entry is differnt that is ok but 'It is difficult to recognize the full picture of the trade like which is main entry and now the main enty of but is lokking same' so i want to make a system when we click on the entry so every other entry linked to that main order can be realize in any good way like a new page opens and tells buy price and every sells price, profit on every sell, like that.
no the way it is doing right now is still doent make a good sense (i m also attching sc) my point is suppose bought anything(futures, intraday or holding) in 1000 qty and selling in 5 times over a time period so like 1st sell is withing 1st week 2nd sell after 10 days,etc so still current system is making ledger but in ledger entries will be in chronological way, which is ok, but its difficult to relate on entry of sell after 30 days to assess it all history, so i wnat this system 
- on R-multiple graph also i want a date on the point alhough getting correct on y axis but also on specific trade points.
